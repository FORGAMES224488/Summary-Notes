    <h1>Chapter Notes: Transfer Pricing</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction & Charging Section</h2>
    <p>Transfer Pricing (TP) provisions aim to ensure that transactions between <strong>Associated Enterprises (AEs)</strong> are conducted at an <strong>Arm's Length Price (ALP)</strong>, as if they were between unrelated parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Charging Section:</strong> <code class="section-ref">Sec 92</code> mandates that income from an <strong>International Transaction</strong> between AEs must be computed having regard to the ALP.</p>
    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Approx. <strong>8-10 marks</strong> in CA Final / CMA; <strong>30 marks</strong> in Elective Paper 6C.</p>

    <h2>2. Key Definitions</h2>

    <h3>2.1. International Transaction <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92B)</code></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A transaction between <strong>two or more AEs</strong>.</li>
        <li>At least <strong>one</strong> of the AEs must be a <strong>Non-Resident</strong>.</li>
        <li>Includes transactions like sale/purchase of goods/services, lending/borrowing, cost allocation, intangibles, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Deemed International Transaction:</strong> Transaction with an unrelated third party can be deemed an IT if:
            <ul>
                <li>There's a <strong>prior agreement</strong> between the AE and the third party regarding the transaction, OR</li>
                <li>The <strong>terms</strong> are substantially determined by the AE.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li>Transactions between two non-residents can be IT if one NR's income is taxable in India.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Associated Enterprise (AE) <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92A)</code></h3>
    <p>Two enterprises are AEs if, at any time during the previous year, one enterprise meets certain conditions with respect to the other. Key conditions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct/Indirect Participation:</strong> Management, control, or capital.</li>
        <li><strong>Shareholding:</strong> Holding <strong class="threshold">≥ 26%</strong> voting power directly or indirectly.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Control (Shares):</strong> One entity holds <strong class="threshold">≥ 26%</strong> voting power in both enterprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan:</strong> Loan advanced constitutes <strong class="threshold">≥ 51%</strong> of the borrower's total assets (book value).</li>
        <li><strong>Guarantee:</strong> Guarantee provided for <strong class="threshold">≥ 10%</strong> of the borrower's total borrowings.</li>
        <li><strong>Board Control:</strong> Appoints > <strong>half the BoD</strong> or <strong>1 Executive Director</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Board Control:</strong> One entity appoints > half BoD or 1 Exec Dir in both enterprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence on Intangibles:</strong> Business wholly dependent on know-how, patents, etc., owned by the other.</li>
        <li><strong>Raw Material Supply:</strong> <strong class="threshold">≥ 90%</strong> raw material supplied by one entity, influencing price.</li>
        <li><strong>Buyer Influence:</strong> Buyer dictates or influences prices significantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Individual/HUF Control:</strong> Controlled by the same individual/relative or HUF/member/relative.</li>
        <li><strong>Firms/AOP/BOI:</strong> Interest of <strong class="threshold">≥ 10%</strong> in profits/capital/beneficial interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Computation of Arm's Length Price (ALP) <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92C)</code></h2>
    <p>ALP must be determined using the <strong>Most Appropriate Method (MAM)</strong>.</p>
    <h3>3.1. Prescribed Methods:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP):</strong> Compares price in AE transaction with price in a comparable uncontrolled transaction. Requires adjustments for functional differences (e.g., CIF/FOB, support, volume discounts, credit terms). Starts with Uncontrolled Price.</li>
        <li><strong>Resale Price Method (RPM):</strong> Used typically for distributors. Starts with Resale Price to unrelated party, reduces normal GP margin & purchase expenses to arrive at ALP (purchase price from AE).</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Plus Method (CPM):</strong> Used typically for manufacturers/service providers. Starts with Cost (direct & indirect), adds normal GP mark-up to arrive at ALP (selling price to AE). Adjust GP for differences (e.g., AE provides support/know-how).</li>
        <li><strong>Profit Split Method (PSM):</strong> Used for highly integrated transactions/joint ventures. Splits combined profit based on relative contributions (FAR analysis: Functions, Assets, Risks).</li>
        <li><strong>Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM):</strong> Compares net profit margin (relative to cost/sales/assets) from AE transaction with margin from comparable uncontrolled transactions or comparable independent companies. Often used when CUP/RPM/CPM are difficult.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> TP provisions do not apply if applying ALP reduces taxable income or increases loss in India.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Multiple ALPs & Range Concept</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Less than 6 ALPs:</strong> Calculate the <strong>average</strong> ALP. If the difference between Actual Transaction Price (ATP) and Average ALP is within <strong class="threshold">±3%</strong> of ATP (or <strong class="threshold">±1%</strong> for wholesale trading), ATP is deemed ALP. Otherwise, Average ALP is the ALP.</li>
        <li><strong>6 or more ALPs (Range Concept):</strong> (Not applicable for PSM)
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange ALPs in <strong>ascending order</strong>.</li>
                <li>Determine the <strong>35th and 65th percentile</strong> values to form the range.
                    <ul><li>If percentile calculation results in non-whole number (e.g., 2.45), use the next whole number position (e.g., 3rd).</li>
                        <li>If it results in a whole number (e.g., 7), use the average of the values at that position and the next position (e.g., average of 7th and 8th).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If ATP falls <strong>within the range</strong>, ATP is the ALP.</li>
                <li>If ATP falls <strong>outside the range</strong>, the <strong>median (50th percentile)</strong> of the dataset is the ALP (calculated using same whole/non-whole number logic).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
         <li><strong>Multi-Year Data:</strong> For RPM, CPM, TNMM, if multiple year data (current + preceding 2 years) is available, use a <strong>weighted average</strong> of the comparable data (margins/percentages), weighted by relevant base (sales for RPM, cost for CPM, cost/sales/assets for TNMM). Calculate average margins first, then apply range concept if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3. Assessing Officer (AO) determining ALP <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92C(3))</code></h3>
    <p>AO can determine ALP if assessee fails to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply MAM.</li>
        <li>Use reliable data.</li>
        <li>Maintain/furnish prescribed documentation (92D).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If AO enhances income via ALP adjustment: No Chapter VIA / Sec 10AA deduction on enhanced income. AE's income remains unaffected.</p>

    <h2>4. Procedural Aspects</h2>

    <h3>4.1. Reference to Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92CA)</code></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>AO may refer ALP computation to TPO (with CIT/PCIT approval).</li>
        <li>TPO has powers to gather information, conduct inquiry.</li>
        <li>TPO's order is <strong>binding</strong> on the AO.</li>
        <li>TPO must pass order at least <strong class="threshold">60 days</strong> before AO's time limit for assessment completion.</li>
        <li>Process becoming faceless.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2. Safe Harbour Rules (SHR) <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92CB)</code></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CBDT can notify rules where declared price/margin is accepted (reduces disputes).</li>
        <li>Currently rules are not notified for exams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3. Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92CC & 92CD)</code></h3>
    <div class="important-concept">
        <p>Agreement between CBDT and assessee determining ALP methodology/specific ALP for future international transactions (<strong>not SDT</strong>).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Max <strong>5 consecutive years</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Binding:</strong> On assessee and tax authorities (up to CIT/PCIT level), unless change in law/facts or fraud/misrepresentation (can be declared void ab initio).</li>
            <li><strong>Rollback:</strong> Option to apply APA to max <strong>4 preceding years</strong> (Total 9 years).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Same transaction, timely return & 92E report filed in rollback years, must apply for all eligible rollback years (no picking), additional fee (<strong class="threshold">₹5 Lakh</strong>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Not allowed if ITAT decided the issue for that year, or if applying rollback reduces income below <strong>returned income</strong> (can reduce below assessed income).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Requires filing <strong>Modified Returns</strong> within <strong>3 months</strong> from end of month APA is entered into. AO recomputes assessment (within 1 year from end of FY of modified return filing) or gets extended time (24m) for pending assessments.</li>
             <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Tiered based on transaction value (₹10L up to 100Cr, ₹15L 100-200Cr, ₹20L >200Cr).</li>
             <li><strong>Amalgamation/Demerger:</strong> Surviving/demerged original entity can get rollback; newly formed entity cannot.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Secondary Adjustment <code class="section-ref">(Sec 92CE)</code></h2>
    <div class="important-concept">
        <p>Arises after a <strong>Primary Adjustment</strong> (increase in taxable income due to ALP application).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Primary adjustment <strong class="threshold">> ₹1 Crore</strong> AND relates to <strong>AY 2017-18 onwards</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Primary adjustment arises from: Suo motu adjustment by assessee, AO order accepted by assessee, APA, SHR, or MAP resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule:</strong> The 'excess money' (amount of primary adjustment) must be repatriated to India within <strong class="threshold">90 days</strong> (time limit calculation varies based on trigger - e.g., from AO order date, from date of filing return if APA entered before due date, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Consequence of Non-Repatriation:</strong> Excess money treated as a <strong>deemed advance/loan</strong> to the AE. <strong>Interest</strong> is imputed annually on this amount and added to assessee's income until repatriation.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>INR Denominated: SBI 1-Year MCLR (as on 1st April of PY) + <strong class="threshold">3.25%</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Foreign Currency: 6-Month LIBOR (as on 30th Sept of PY) + <strong class="threshold">3.00%</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>One-Time Tax Option:</strong> Assessee can opt to pay additional tax @ <strong class="threshold">18%</strong> + 12% Surcharge + 4% Cess (Effective ≈ 20.966%) on the non-repatriated amount. Payment stops further secondary adjustment interest imputation.</li>
