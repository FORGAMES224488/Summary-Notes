    <h1>Chapter Summary: Double Taxation Relief (DTAA)</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Double Taxation</h2>
    <p><strong>Double Taxation:</strong> Taxing the same income twice.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Juridical Double Taxation:</strong> Same person taxed on same income in two countries (due to Residence Rule & Source Rule). This is addressed by DTAA.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Double Taxation:</strong> Same income taxed in the hands of two different persons (e.g., company profit tax & shareholder dividend tax). Addressed differently (e.g., MAP).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA)</h2>
    <p>Agreements (Tax Treaties/Conventions) between countries to prevent/mitigate double taxation.</p>
    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid double taxation.</li>
        <li>Facilitate Exchange of Information (EoI).</li>
        <li>Mutual assistance in tax recovery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Methods of Relief (Commonly):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exemption Method:</strong> One country exempts the income.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit Method:</strong> Both countries tax; resident country gives credit for tax paid in source country. <strong>India primarily uses the Credit Method.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Power to Enter DTAA:</strong> Central Government (Section 90 with foreign countries/territories; Section 90A allows specified associations to enter similar agreements with ratification).</p>

    <h2>3. DTAA vs. Income Tax Act, 1961</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If conflict exists, provisions of <strong>DTAA or Act, whichever is more beneficial</strong> to the assessee, shall apply (Section 90(2)).</li>
        <li><strong>Exception:</strong> A higher tax rate specified in the Act for a foreign company compared to a domestic company is <strong>not</strong> considered less favourable for the foreign company just because of the rate difference (Proviso to Sec 90(2)). DTAA benefits other than rate still apply.</li>
        <li><strong>GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule)</strong> provisions can override DTAA benefits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Tax Residency Certificate (TRC)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Required for a non-resident to claim DTAA benefits in India.</li>
        <li>Must be obtained from the government of the country of residence.</li>
        <li>Assessee must also furnish details like Status, Nationality, TIN, Address, PAN (if any) in India (often part of TRC, else separately in Form 10F).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Interpretation of Terms in DTAA</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If defined in DTAA, use that definition.</li>
        <li>If not defined in DTAA but defined in Income Tax Act, use Act's definition (unless context requires otherwise).</li>
        <li>If not defined in either, use meaning assigned via government Notification (contextual).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. Unilateral Relief (Section 91)</h2>
    <p>Relief provided by India when income is earned from a country with which India has <strong>no DTAA</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Conditions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assessee is Resident in India.</li>
        <li>Income accrued/arose outside India (and not deemed to accrue/arise in India).</li>
        <li>Income taxed in both India and the foreign country.</li>
        <li>Tax paid on such income in the foreign country.</li>
        <li>No DTAA exists between India and that country.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Calculation of Relief:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculate Indian Average Rate of Tax (ART): (Indian Tax / Total Income) * 100.
            <span class="note">Note: Indian Tax is computed after adding Surcharge & Cess, but before Sec 91 relief.</span></li>
        <li>Calculate Foreign Average Rate of Tax: (Foreign Tax Paid / Foreign Income as per Foreign Law) * 100.</li>
        <li>Identify Doubly Taxed Income (Foreign income included in Indian Total Income).</li>
        <li><strong>Relief Amount = Doubly Taxed Income * Lower of (Indian ART vs. Foreign Rate)</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>7. Permanent Establishment (PE)</h2>
    <p>A concept (often defined in DTAAs, Article 5 in model conventions) determining a country's right to tax business profits of a foreign enterprise.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Source country taxes business profits only if the foreign enterprise has a PE there.</li>
        <li>Includes fixed places like place of management, branch, office, factory, workshop, mine, etc.</li>
        <li>Distinction: Business *IN* a foreign country (taxable if PE exists) vs. Business *WITH* a foreign country (generally not taxable in source country without PE).</li>
        <li>A BPO unit can be a PE if it meets the definition criteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) Rules (Rule 128)</h2>
    <p>Rules governing the mechanism for claiming credit for foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 90/90A (DTAA) or Section 91 (Unilateral Relief).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eligibility Year:</strong> Credit available in the year the corresponding income is offered to tax in India.</li>
        <li><strong>Allowed Against:</strong> Income Tax, Surcharge, Cess. <strong>Not</strong> against Interest, Fees, Penalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Disputed Tax:</strong> Claim credit after dispute resolution (within 6 months of resolution).</li>
        <li><strong>Amount of Credit:</strong> Lower of:
            <ul>
                <li>Tax payable on such income under Indian Income Tax Act.</li>
                <li>Foreign tax paid on such income.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
         <li><strong>FTC against MAT/AMT:</strong> Allowed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Procedural Aspects for FTC (Rule 128)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form 67:</strong> Mandatory online form to be filed to claim FTC.</li>
        <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Details of foreign income, tax paid, proof (TDS cert, challan, statement).</li>
        <li><strong>Due Date for Form 67:</strong> <em><span class="amendment">On or before the end of the relevant Assessment Year.</span></em> (Amended from earlier requirement of filing by return due date).</li>
        <li><strong>Currency Conversion (for Tax Paid Abroad):</strong> Convert foreign tax paid to INR using the <strong>TTBR (SBI)</strong> on the <strong>last day of the month preceding</strong> the month in which the tax was paid/deducted.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
        <strong>FTC Calculation Clarification (Rate vs. Amount):</strong>
        <ul>
             <li>Generally, compare Indian Avg Rate vs Foreign Rate and multiply by Doubly Taxed Income (as in Sec 91).</li>
             <li><strong>However,</strong> if the <strong>actual foreign tax amount</strong> (in foreign currency), the <strong>date of payment/deduction</strong>, and the corresponding <strong>TTBR</strong> (as per Rule 128) are available, then:
                <ol>
                    <li>Convert the foreign tax amount to INR using the specified TTBR.</li>
                    <li>Calculate the Indian tax attributable to that foreign income.</li>
                    <li>FTC = Lower of these two <strong>amounts</strong>. (Rate comparison is implicitly done).</li>
                </ol>
             </li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h2>10. Currency Conversion for Income Calculation (Rule 115)</h2>
    <p>Prescribes rates for converting income earned in foreign currency to INR for tax calculation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Salary, Interest on Securities, Dividends, Capital Gains:</strong> TTBR (SBI) of the last day of the <strong>month preceding</strong> the month the income accrues/arises.</li>
        <li><strong>House Property, PGBP (other than shipping), Other Sources (other than Int/Div):</strong> TTBR (SBI) of the <strong>last day of the previous year</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>PGBP - Non-Resident Shipping (Sec 172):</strong> TTBR (SBI) of the last day of the <strong>month preceding</strong> the month income is earned.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception:</strong> If TDS has been deducted in India on any income (Salary, Cap Gains, Int etc.), use the TTBR on the date tax was <strong>required to be deducted</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Currency Conversion for TDS on Payments (Rule 26)</h2>
    <p>For deducting tax (TDS) on income payable in foreign currency (e.g., payment to non-resident).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Convert the income payable to INR using the <strong>TTBR</strong> (of that currency) on the <strong>date tax is required to be deducted</strong>. Calculate TDS on this INR amount.</li>
    </ul>
